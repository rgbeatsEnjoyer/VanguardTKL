A low profile, 67 key FRLTKL. This keyboard uses Choc switches (V1 only), and runs QMK. This keyboard requires an Elite-C microcontroler (a standard promicro cannot be used as it doesn't have enough IO pins for both the keymatrix and the OLED) Assembly involves some soldering (both through-hole and SMD)
